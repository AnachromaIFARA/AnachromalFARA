## 🔍 Research Focus

My work develops and formalizes the **Minimal Architecture of Distinguishability (ANAM)** — a generative structural framework describing how differences, form, dynamics, and physical layers emerge from the minimal act of distinguishability.

Research areas include:

- Foundational architectures of reality  
- Generative structures and A/B/G/N deployment  
- Structural invariants and threshold laws  
- Physics–cognition interface  
- Methodological foundations of science  
- Non-empirical theoretical reconstruction  
- Cognitive limitations and reconstruction mechanisms  
- Distinguishability theory and minimal transition logic
